        "analysis": "Based on the image features provided and the professional knowledge for formal analysis, I'll analyze the drawing in sequence:\n\n## Sense of Distance\nThe drawing shows an appropriate distance, which suggests that the individual has adequate mobility, a sense of reality, calmness, and planning ability. This indicates a balanced perception of their environment and relationships.\n\n## Size Proportion\nThe size of the drawing is normal, occupying an appropriate amount of space on the paper. This suggests a balanced self-perception and a realistic view of one's place in the world.\n\n## Position\nThe drawing occupies a normal position on the paper, with the blank space being less than 2/3 of the paper. This indicates a generally healthy relationship with the environment and a lack of extreme feelings of inadequacy or grandiosity.\n\n## Lines\nThe drawing features short lines, straight lines, disconnected lines, and smooth curves. This combination suggests:\n- Short lines: The individual may be easily excitable or impulsive.\n- Straight lines: There's a tendency towards self-assertion and possibly inflexibility in dealing with situations.\n- Disconnected lines: This might indicate some hostility or unresolved conflicts.\n- Smooth curves: These suggest femininity, dependency, freedom, and good adaptability.\n\n## Shadows and Shading\nThe presence of shading in the drawing could indicate hypersensitivity in interpersonal relationships, anxiety, or some level of unease towards the outside world.\n\n## Erasure Marks\nNo erasure marks are noted, which suggests confidence in decision-making and a lack of excessive perfectionism or anxiety about the drawing process.\n\n## Symmetry\nThe symmetry is described as normal, indicating a balanced personality without extreme tendencies towards obsessiveness or disorganization.\n\n## Transparency\nNo abnormalities in transparency are noted, suggesting a clear boundary between internal and external worlds.\n\n## Dimensionality\nThe drawing presents a normal, eye-level view, indicating a balanced perspective on life and relationships without feelings of superiority or inferiority.\n\n## Direction\nThe house is facing front, which could indicate a rigid personality or an uncompromising attitude towards certain aspects of life.\n\n## Level of Detail\nThe drawing is described as detailed, which suggests an awareness of practical and concrete aspects of daily life and concern for self-management ability.\n\n## Movement\nNo movement is depicted, which might indicate a focus on stability or a current state of inaction in the individual's life.\n\n## Ground Line\nNo abnormality is noted in the ground line, suggesting a stable sense of reality and grounding.\n\nOverall, this drawing presents a mix of elements that suggest a complex individual with generally balanced perceptions but some areas of potential conflict or unease. The detailed nature of the drawing, combined with the use of various line types and shading, indicates a person who is aware of their environment and has the capacity for nuanced thinking, but may also experience some internal tensions or anxieties."

        "analysis": "I apologize, but I don't have any information about image features provided by an assistant for this particular image. The image you've shared is a sketch of a rural scene with a house, trees, and some text, but it doesn't contain a clear depiction of a person that would be suitable for the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test analysis you're requesting.\n\nThe image shows:\n- A small house or cabin with a pitched roof and a steeple or bell tower\n- Several trees surrounding the house\n- A sign or plaque in the foreground with the text \"HOME OF THE DEAD\"\n- The entire scene is drawn in a sketchy, blue ink style\n\nWithout a human figure to analyze, I can't provide the specific psychological projection analysis you're looking for regarding person content.

        "analysis": "Based on the image provided and the professional knowledge for tree content analysis, I'll analyze the features of the trees in this drawing:\n\n### I. Theme\n- **Tree species**: Not specified, appears to be generic deciduous trees\n- **Leaf type**: Deciduous, as the trees are depicted with bare branches\n- **Tree condition**: The trees appear withered or bare, which may represent negative emotions such as depression, powerlessness, or a sense of loss. This could suggest that the subject is experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma.\n\n### II. Trunk\n- **Size**: Medium to large, suggesting a proactive attitude but possibly also indicating some aggressiveness or inner tension\n- **Shape**: Irregular and somewhat distorted, which might indicate flexibility but also potential instability in the subject's personality\n- **Outline**: Emphasized with strong, dark lines, possibly representing the subject's efforts to maintain a unified personality in the face of challenges\n\n### III. Bark\n- **Level of detail**: Minimal, with emphasis on the overall shape rather than texture\n- **Shading**: Present, with darker areas creating a sense of depth and possibly indicating inner complexity\n- **Texture**: Rough and sketchy, which may suggest some dissatisfaction or inner turmoil\n\n### IV. Branches\n- **Form**: Broken and chaotic, extending in various directions. This could represent psychological trauma, feelings of powerlessness, or concern about personal inadequacies. It may also indicate unconventional thinking or creativity, but with a sense of inner conflict.\n- **Shading**: Present, with varying line thickness creating depth and possibly suggesting complexity in social interactions\n\n### V. Crown\n- **Size**: Large in proportion to the trunk, which might indicate ambition or a focus on specific tasks, but also potential inner turmoil\n- **Shape**: Skeletal and chaotic, which may represent fear of reality, outward politeness but possible inner complexity, and perhaps some dishonesty with oneself\n- **Other**: Branches extend beyond what would be a typical crown shape, suggesting possible withdrawal tendencies or disharmony with the environment\n\n### VI. Roots\n- **Visibility**: Not clearly visible, which is typical in many tree drawings\n- **Connection**: The trees appear grounded, but the connection to the earth is not emphasized\n\n### VII. Ground Line\n- **Degree of emphasis**: Moderate, with the ground suggested by the placement of elements rather than a clear line\n- **Shape**: Irregular and implied rather than explicitly drawn\n- **Position**: Below the base of the trees, which is typical and doesn't suggest any particular psychological significance\n\n### VIII. Other Elements\n- **Leaves**: Absent, which reinforces the withered or bare appearance of the trees\n- **Natural Elements**: The sky is suggested by the blank space above, creating a stark contrast with the dark trees\n\n### Overall Interpretation\nThe trees in this image appear to symbolize a complex emotional state. The withered, bare appearance with chaotic branches suggests the subject may be experiencing feelings of loss, inner turmoil, or psychological strain. The strong, emphasized outlines might indicate attempts to maintain a coherent self-image despite these challenges. The large, sprawling crowns could represent ambition or a desire for growth, but the skeletal nature of the branches implies that this growth feels hindered or incomplete.\n\nThe overall composition, with the trees framing a central building labeled \"Home of the Dead,\" adds a layer of morbidity and potential preoccupation with mortality or loss. This context significantly influences the interpretation of the trees, suggesting they may represent guardians or witnesses to themes of death or abandonment.\n\nIn conclusion, the tree imagery in this drawing appears to reflect complex emotional states, possibly including depression, anxiety, or unresolved trauma, but also resilience and a desire for growth despite challenging circumstances."

        "analysis": "Based on the image features provided and the professional knowledge for house content analysis, I'll analyze the drawing in order:\n\n## 1. House Theme\nThe house theme appears to be a cemetery or similar setting, as indicated by the \"Home of the Dead\" text in the image. This is an unusual choice that deviates from typical residential themes. It may reflect:\n\n- A preoccupation with mortality or loss\n- Feelings of isolation or separation from the living world\n- Possible unresolved grief or trauma related to death\n- A metaphorical representation of the subject's emotional state, feeling \"dead\" inside or disconnected from life\n\n## 2. Roof\nThe roof is described as having a heavy roofline. This feature suggests:\n\n- Fear of inability to control and escape fantasy life\n- Anxiety and effort to control oneself\n- Possible early stage of mental illness or psychological distress\n- Attempt to maintain psychological balance in the face of difficult emotions or experiences\n\n## 3. Walls\nThe walls have emphasized outlines, which may indicate:\n\n- Early-stage mental illness or psychological struggle\n- Efforts to maintain self-balance and personality integration\n- Attempt to create clear boundaries between self and the external world\n- Possible feelings of vulnerability or need for protection\n\n## 4. Doors\nThe presence of an open door suggests:\n\n- Desire for acceptance of others' enthusiasm\n- Wish to leave a social impression\n- Openness to external influences or experiences\n- Possible longing for connection despite the morbid theme\n\n## 5. Windows\nThe windows are described as plain openings without decoration, which may indicate:\n\n- A realistic outlook on life\n- Bluntness or directness in emotional expression\n- Lack of barriers between inner and outer worlds\n- Possible vulnerability or lack of protection from external influences\n\n## 6. Chimney and Smoke\nNo chimney or smoke is observed, which might suggest:\n\n- Lack of warmth or comfort in familial or interpersonal relationships\n- Absence of internal conflicts being expressed outwardly\n- Possible emotional coldness or disconnection\n\n## 7. Fences and Ditches\nNo fences or ditches are observed, potentially indicating:\n\n- Less defensive mechanisms in place\n- Openness to external influences, whether positive or negative\n- Lack of clear boundaries between self and others\n\n## 8. Awnings and Sunshades\nThe absence of awnings or sunshades might suggest:\n\n- Less need for protection from external \"elements\"\n- Openness to experiences, both positive and negative\n- Possible lack of self-protective mechanisms\n\n## 9. Flowers and Trees\nTrees are present in the image, which could indicate:\n\n- Attempt to maintain a sense of life or growth in a \"dead\" environment\n- Desire for security and protection\n- Possible internal conflict between life and death themes\n\n## 10. Roads, Mountains\nNo roads or mountains are observed, which might suggest:\n\n- Lack of clear direction or path in life\n- Absence of perceived obstacles or challenges\n- Focus on the immediate surroundings rather than distant horizons\n\n## 11. Other Accessories\nNo other accessories are noted, which could indicate:\n\n- Simplicity in life outlook\n- Focus on core elements rather than details\n- Possible lack of engagement with everyday life aspects\n\nIn conclusion, this unusual house drawing with its cemetery theme suggests deep-seated emotional issues, possibly related to loss, isolation, or a sense of disconnection from life. The subject may be struggling with maintaining psychological balance while dealing with heavy emotional burdens. The open door and plain windows indicate a paradoxical desire for connection despite the overall morbid theme, suggesting a complex internal struggle between isolation and the need for human interaction."

Tendency Summary\nTotal number of positive signals: 7\nTotal number of negative signals: 7\nTotal number of neutral signals: 9\n\nNOTE: The equal number of positive and negative signals suggests a complex psychological state with both strengths and challenges. The presence of several negative signals, particularly in the house and tree analyses, indicates potential emotional distress or unresolved issues that may require attention. The positive signals in the formal features analysis suggest some resilience and coping mechanisms. Given the morbid theme of the \"Home of the Dead\" and the withered trees, it would be advisable to explore any feelings of loss, isolation, or depression with the individual. Professional psychological support might be beneficial to address these underlying issues and build upon the positive aspects identified in the analysis.",
    "final": "<output>\n\n# HTP Test Opinion\n\n## Assessment Evaluation\n\n1. Formal Analysis\n\nThe subject's HTP test reveals a complex psychological profile with both strengths and areas of concern. The formal features of the drawing demonstrate several positive attributes, including an appropriate sense of proportion, balanced self-perception, and confidence in decision-making. The normal positioning and symmetry suggest a generally balanced personality and realistic view of one's place in the world. However, the presence of shading and the use of short, disconnected lines indicate potential underlying anxiety and impulsiveness.\n\n2. Content Analysis\n\n- House: The depiction of a cemetery or \"Home of the Dead\" as the house theme is highly atypical and warrants careful consideration. This unusual choice may reflect deep-seated feelings of isolation, loss, or a preoccupation with mortality. The heavy roofline and emphasized wall outlines suggest efforts to maintain psychological balance in the face of significant emotional challenges. The open door, however, indicates a desire for acceptance and openness to external influences, which could be leveraged as a positive aspect in potential interventions.\n\n- Tree: The tree content analysis reveals significant psychological distress. The withered or bare appearance of the trees, coupled with broken and chaotic branches, strongly suggests feelings of depression, powerlessness, and possible trauma. The large crown in proportion to the trunk indicates ambition conflicting with inner turmoil, while the skeletal and chaotic crown shape may represent fear of reality or complex inner struggles.\n\n- Person: The absence of a person in the drawing is noteworthy. While this is not inherently negative, it may indicate difficulties with self-concept or interpersonal relationships that warrant further exploration.\n\n3. Summary\n\nThe HTP test results present a nuanced picture of the subject's psychological state. There are 7 positive signals, primarily in the formal features, indicating some degree of psychological resilience and coping mechanisms. However, these are counterbalanced by 7 negative signals, predominantly in the content analysis, suggesting significant emotional distress and unresolved issues.\n\nThe strength of the negative signal information is considerable, particularly evident in the morbid house theme and the distressed representation of trees. The strength of the positive signal information, while present, appears less robust in comparison.\n\nWarning: Given the intensity of the negative signals, particularly the death-related imagery and indicators of possible depression or trauma, this individual requires careful observation and may benefit from professional psychological support. The balance between positive and negative indicators suggests potential for improvement with appropriate intervention, but the severity of some negative signals warrants immediate attention to ensure the individual's well-being.\n\n</output>",
